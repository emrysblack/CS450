When your assignment is complete, please answer the questions in this text file and upload it to I-Learn.


1. Please describe your experiment/results for the Vowel dataset. How many different parameters did you try? What was the highest accuracy you obtained, and what were the parameters that produced it?
I loaded the data and played around with the values. I tried around 13 combos for the params
My highest accuracy was 94% with a gamma of .01 and a cost of 15

2. Please describe your experiment/results for the Letters dataset. How many different parameters did you try? What was the highest accuracy you obtained, and what were the parameters that produced it?
I loaded the data and played around with the values. I tried 10 combos for the params, this one took longer to process
My highest accuracy was 97% with a gamma of .1 and a cost of 10

3. Please describe your experiment/results for the Abalone dataset. How many different parameters did you try? What was the highest accuracy you obtained, and what were the parameters that produced it?
This one was fairly quick to run. I tried around 25 different param combinations since neither little changes nor big changes seemed to do much in the end
I only got up to a 57% accuracy with a gamma of .01 and a cost of15

4. Describe anything you did to go above and beyond the minimum standard requirements.



5. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:

D - Meets requirements



6. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I followed the instructions. I did use R to test drive it, and I did a two extra datasets to experiment with, but it wasn't very difficult so I
don't think that would count as above and beyond
