Describe your overall approach to implementing the algorithm in code. How are your classes/data structures organized? How do you keep track of the necessary pieces for back-propagation.
I had a class for the nerual network. the network had a list with all the values and another list with all the weights
I used the values of -1 for the bias nodes and to determine when a layer ended or began.
I updated the weights into a new temporary list and then copied that over the weight list after it was all done computing

Describe the part of the assignment that gave you the most trouble, and how you overcame it.
Getting the regression to update properly. It would run, but wouldn't learn.
I erased everything and started over.

Compare your results on the Iris dataset to those of an existing implementation.
28% mine to 96% knn

Please state which category you feel best describes your assignment and give a 1-2 sentence justification for your choice: 
A) Some attempt was made - I made the network and it worked in one direction, but it wouldn't learn. So I scrapped it and started over, but I didn't get it off the ground since I am still developing an alternative approach.
