After completing your project report, please self evaluate the project and the contribution of each member of the team (including yourself). For each question, please use the following scale:

--------------------------------------------------
A - Not present or extremely minimal
B - Developing but significantly deficient
C - Slightly deficient but still mostly adequate
D - Meets requirements
E - Above and beyond expectations
---------------------------------------------------

For each question, place the letter corresponding to the desired category in front of the question so that:

 - 1. Demonstrates understanding of the business needs / context of the data
 - 2. Demonstrates ability to handle non-trivial dataset
...

Becomes something like:

D - 1. Demonstrates understanding of the business needs / context of the data
E - 2. Demonstrates ability to handle non-trivial dataset
...

Then, provide a description / justification at the end.

 D - 1. Demonstrates understanding of the business needs / context of the data
 D - 2. Demonstrates ability to handle non-trivial dataset
 D - 3. Demonstrates proper algorithm selection and application
 C - 4. Discovered something interesting / of value
 D - 5. Demonstrates understanding of limitations of the solution and potential ethical issues
 D - 6. Conversant in appropriate terminology and technologies
 D - 7. Overall Project

8. Please provide any overall comments about the project and a justification for your selections here:
We took what we were given and tackled the problem with some new algorithms. We explored LDA which we 
hadn't had a chance to use in class. We explored other algorithms that could further help us make connections in the data.
We didn't feel like we had a big breakthrough despite our efforts.

Focused in on the data we wanted to look at. Looked at R and LDA as a good direction
for data exploration. Came up with ideas to overcome challenges.

6. Please briefly describe this team member's contribution and justify your selections above:
Wrestled with the data and worked to get it to fit the algorithms. Hooked up the API to gather data for analysis.
Used both Python and R in tandem to work with the dataset and produce graphs of our findings.
